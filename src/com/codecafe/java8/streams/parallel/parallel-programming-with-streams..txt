 Parallel Programming with Streams
-----------------------------------

+ Parallel as a master switch +

In Imperative style, the structure of sequential code is very different from the structure of the concurrent code.

But using streams, the structure of sequential code is identical to the structure of concurrent code.

There are two ways to make your stream parallel.

Example : SequentialAndParallelStream.java

1. If you are the creator of the stream                                                                        -->  use parallelStream()
2. If you are not the creator of the stream and you want to parallelize it after the stream has been created   -->  use stream.parallel()


Question : If there is a parallel(), is there also a sequential() ?

Answer : Yes ! There is a sequential() as well.

Example 1
---------
use(numbers.parallelStream());

private static void use(Stream<Integer> stream) {

     stream
         .sequential()
         .map(e -> transform(e))
         .forEach(System.out::println);
}

What will happen ??

Even though we created a parallel stream, it will be executed sequentially.


Example 2
---------
use(numbers.stream());

private static void use(Stream<Integer> stream) {

     stream
         .parallel()
         .map(e -> transform(e))
         .sequential()
         .forEach(System.out::println);
}

What will happen ??

We can naively think that the map() will run in parallel but forEach() will run in sequential mode.

Unfortunately, this is not the case. In this kind of scenario, the LAST ONE WINS !!

THE LAST ONE means the one before the terminal operation.

So parallel() in this case will be a "no operation" because sequential() before the terminal operation forEach() will make
the behavior of the entire pipeline SEQUENTIAL.

+ FYI note +
There are two operations offered by streams :

1. Intermediate operations -> these are lazy evaluations and are postponed until you hit a terminal operation.
2. Terminal operations -> these are the decisive operations.
